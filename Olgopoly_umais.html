   <ul class="ul"><h3>Objectives</h3>
      <li>To examine the nature of an oligopoly market
      <li>To understand the indeterminate demand curve
for a firm under oligopoly
      <li>To look into the various models of price and
 output decisions under oligopoly.
      <li>To understand the concept of Kinked demand
 Curve.
   </ul><hr>

      <ol class="ol" type="a"><h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <li>Derived from Greek word: “oligo” (few) “polo” (to sell).
      <li>A few dominant sellers sell differentiated or homogenous products
 under continuous consciousness of rivals’ actions.
      <li>Oligopoly looks similar to other market forms; as there can be
many sellers (like in monopolistic competition), but a few very large
sellers dominate the market.
      <li>Products sold may be homogenous (like in perfect competition), or
differentiated (like in monopolistic competition).
      <li>Entry is not restricted but difficult due to requirement of
investments.
      <li>One aspect which differentiates oligopoly from all other market
forms, is the interdependence of various firms: no player can take a
decision without considering the action (or reaction) of rivals.
      </ol><hr>

      <ol class="ol" type="a"><h2><a name="features">Features of Oligopoly</a></h2>
      <li><strong>Few Sellers:</strong> small number of large firms
 compete.
      <li><strong>Product:</strong> Some industries may consist of firms
 selling identical products, while in some other
 industries firms may be selling differentiated
 products.
      <li><strong>Entry Barriers:</strong> No legal barriers; only economic in
 nature
          <ul type="square">
                <li>Huge investment requirements
                <li>Strong consumer loyalty for existing brands
                <li>Economies of scale
          </ul>
      <li><strong>Non Price Competition:</strong> Firms are continuously watching
 their rivals, each of them avoids the incidence of a price
 war.

          <ul type="square">
                <li>
Two firms A & B sell a homogenous
product and sell at P1.
                <li>
Firm A lowers the price to gain
 market share.
                <li>B fears loss of its customers and
 retorts by lowering the price below
 that of A.
                <li>A further reduces the price and this
 process continues.
                <li>The two firms reach P2.
Both realize that this price war is not
helping either of them and decide to
 end the war.
                <li>Price again stabilises at P2.

      <li><strong>Indeterminate Demand Curve</strong>

             <ul type="square">
                <li>Price and output determination is
 very complex as each firm faces
 two demand curves.
                <li>Demand is not only affected by its
 own price or advertisement or
quality, but is also affected by the
 price of rival products, their quality,
 packaging, promotion and
 placement.
                <li>When the firm increases the price it
 faces less elastic demand (D1
D1
)
                <li>When it reduces the price it faces
 highly elastic demand (DD)
      </ul></ol><hr>

    <ol type="a"><h2><a name="kinked">Kinked Demand Curve</a></h2>
      <li>Paul Sweezy (1939) introduced concept of kinked demand curve to
 explain ‘price stickiness’.
      <li><strong>Assumptions</strong>
         <ul type="square">
            <li>If a firm decreases price, others will also do the same. So, the
firm initially faces a highly elastic demand curve.
            <li>A price reduction will give some gains to the firm initially, but
due to similar reaction by rivals, this increase in demand will not
be sustained.
            <li>If a firm increases its price, others will not follow. Firm will lose
large number of its customers to rivals due to substitution effect.
            <li>Thus an oligopoly firm faces a highly elastic demand in case of
price fall and highly inelastic demand in case of price rise.
         </ul>
      <li>A firm has no option but to stick to its current price.
      <li>At current price a kink is developed in the demand curve.
      <li>The demand curve is more elastic above the kink and less elastic
 below the kink.

            <li>Discontinuity in AR (D1
KD2
)
creates discontinuity in the MR
 curve.
            <li>At the kink (K), MR is constant
 between point A and B.
            <li>Producer will produce OQ,
whether it is operating on MC1
 or
 MC2
, since the profit maximizing
 conditions are being fulfilled at
 points S as well as T.
            <li>If MC fluctuates between A and B,
 the firm will neither change its
 output nor its price.
            <li>It will change its output and price
 only if MC moves above A or
 below B.
   </ul><hr>


   <ol type="a"> <h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
      <li>Oligopoly is a market with a few sellers, differentiated or
 homogenous product, interdependent decision making by firms,
 non price competition and indeterminate demand curve.
      <li>Difficulty in determining the demand curve, tendency to influence
market conditions and fear of price war resulting in price rigidity
 are some of the reasons which pose a major constraint in
developing a model to explain oligopoly.
      <li>In Sweezy’s kinked demand curve model firms avoid a situation like
price war; therefore they stick to the current price. Thus the
oligopoly price remains rigid.
      <li>The kink in demand curve signifies that the demand curve has two
different degrees of price elasticity.
